I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of California, Los
Angeles (UCLA), pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computational and Systems 
Biology with a minor in Geography. To learn more about me, scroll down or check

I was born in Portland, Oregon. That will always be my home. My family moved to
Cupertino, California, during the summer after I completed second grade. I lived 
there until we moved to Fremont, California. I went to Weibel Elementary School
for sixth grade, and then to Horner Junior High School for seventh and eighth
grade. I then went to Irvington High School. 

Portland was important, Cupertino was formative, Fremont was weird. It still is.

I have a younger sister, Supriya, and a dog, <a href="/images/crispr.jpeg" target="_blank" >Crispr</a>.

I have been incredibly fortunate to have parents who encouraged me to
and supported me pursuing multiple hobbies. I started playing chess, guitar, and 
soccer in Oregon, and continued all three throughout high school. I still play 
chess competitively. I need to get back into guitar.

I played club soccer throughout high school and have played on a few intramural
teams at UCLA. I played club ultimate frisbee at UCLA for two years. 

More recently, I have started running and lifting. Spending a summer in Boston
has made me like cooking. I also have gotten back into reading and writing for 
fun. I love and always will love politics, hiking, backpacking, traveling, and 
board games.

A running list of other things in no particular order:

My biggest role models are my parents. 

I like doing a lot of projects in a lot of different areas.

Having non-negotiables is a non-negotiable.

I came into UCLA intending to double major in CASB and political science. 
Unfortunately, that did not seem feasible. I chose to stick with CASB and take
as many political science classes as possible, especially upper-division ones
that piqued my interest. My most memorable class thus far has been my senior
thesis class in political science, which I completed in spring of my freshman
year. On the CASB side, I have loved the graduate-level class STATS M254: 
Statistical Methods in Computational Biology, the most. 

At UCLA, I am involved in a number of clubs, including the <a href="https://bruinreview.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Bruin Review</a>, the <a href="
https://datascienceunion.com/" target="_blank">Data Science Union</a>, and <a href="https://matriculate.org/" target="_blank">Matriculate</a>.

I have been a dry-lab bioinformatics undergraduate researcher in the <a href="https://www.mfwellslab.com/" target="_blank">Wells Lab</a>.
